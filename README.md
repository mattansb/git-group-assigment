# GIT and GITHUB Group Assignments

1. Choose a group leader
2. The leader will **fork** the repo at: https://github.com/mattansb/git-group-assigment
3. The leader will invite you to their branch (Settings > Collaborators > Add people)
4. Each person will then **clone** the repo locally to your computer.



Each group has a sub-folder. Within that folder, you will find a list of facts in a `.md` file
(we will learn more about these types of files next week).



Your job, as a group, is to:

1. Make a new branch - on this branch you will correct the facts.
2. On the main branch - add some new facts.
3. Make a pull request (PR), review it, and merge the new branch into the "main" branch.
4. The group leader will make a PR into *my* repo.



**EACH of the your teammates must make at least one commit to get full credit for this assigment.**



Don't forget:

* `fetch` -> `commit` -> `push` -> ...
* Be careful of creating any conflicts!



***Good luck!***
